This project utilizes a machine learning approach to predict ethnicities based on customer names. Two datasets were used for this project. The first dataset was used as the training data for ML models where the model learns patterns and associations between customer names and ethnicities. Simultaneously, there exists a secondary dataset containing customer names for which ethnicity predictions needs to be predicted. However, due to the sensitive nature of customer information, particularly their full names and ethnicities, the datasets are not uploaded.

Nevertheless, to showcase the outcomes and effectiveness of the model, the project presents the results of the three models used in the form of a confusion matrix. This matrix provides a visual representation of the model's performance in predicting ethnicities for the secondary dataset.

Data details:
Type of prediction: Multi Level Non Ordered Classificaion
Classes: 4 (Malay, Indian, Chinese, Others)
